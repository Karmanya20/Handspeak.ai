        <p>A scrollbar is a graphical user interface used to represent a document or webpage that is larger than the visible area. By default, web browsers provide a scrollbar with a predefined style, but with HTML and CSS, you can create a custom scrollbar that matches your website’s design and layout.

            The scrollbar element has various pseudo-elements such as ::-webkit-scrollbar, ::-webkit-scrollbar-track, ::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb, and ::-webkit-scrollbar-button that can be used to apply different styles. You can customize the scrollbar’s width, color, background, border, and other properties to match your website’s design. 
            
            It is important to note that custom scrollbars are not supported in all browsers, and the level of customization you can achieve may vary depending on the browser. 
            
             
            
            Approach: To create a custom scrollbar using HTML and CSS, you can follow these general steps:
            
            Create a container element that will hold the content and the scrollbar. This can be a div or any other HTML element.
            Set the height of the container element to a fixed value, and add overflow-y: scroll to enable the scrollbar. This will allow the content to be scrolled vertically.
            Use CSS to style the scrollbar elements, such as ::-webkit-scrollbar, ::-webkit-scrollbar-track, ::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb, and ::-webkit-scrollbar-button for WebKit-based browsers, and ::-moz-scrollbar, ::-moz-scrollbar-track, ::-moz-scrollbar-thumb, and ::-moz-scrollbar-button for Firefox.
            Customize the scrollbar’s width, color, background, border, and other properties using CSS.
            Add any additional styling, such as hover and active states for the scrollbar elements, to enhance the user experience.
            Finally, test the custom scrollbar in different web browsers to ensure that it works as intended and that it is visually appealing.
            Note: Not all browsers support custom scrollbars using CSS, so it’s important to provide fallback styles for browsers that do not support them.  You can do this by using conditional CSS statements or JavaScript to detect the user’s browser and apply different styles accordingly.
            
            Example: This example shows the use of the above-explained approach.

                    <strong>What is Data Structure?</strong> 
                    <p> 
                        A data structure is defined as a particular 
                        way of storing and organizing data in our 
                        devices to use the data efficiently and 
                        effectively. The main idea behind using 
                        data structures is to minimize the time 
                        and space complexities. An efficient data 
                        structure takes minimum memory space and 
                        requires minimum time to execute the data. 
                    </p> 
              
                    <strong>What is Algorithm?</strong> 
                    <p> 
                        Algorithm is defined as a process or set 
                        of well-defined instructions that are 
                        typically used to solve a particular group 
                        of problems or perform a specific type of 
                        calculation. To explain in simpler terms, 
                        it is a set of operations performed in a 
                        step-by-step manner to execute a task.

                    <strong>How to start learning DSA?</strong> 
                    <p> 
                        The first and foremost thing is dividing 
                        the total procedure into little pieces 
                        which need to be done sequentially. The 
                        complete process to learn DSA from 
                        scratch can be broken into 4 parts: 
                    </p> 
              
                    <li>Learn about Time and Space complexities</li> 
                    <li> 
                        Learn the basics of individual 
                        Data Structures

                    <li>Learn the basics of Algorithms</li> 
                    <li>Practice Problems on DSA</li> 
              
                    <strong> 1. Learn about Complexities</strong> 
                    <p> 
                        Here comes one of the interesting and 
                        important topics. The primary motive to 
                        use DSA is to solve a problem effectively 
                        and efficiently. How can you decide if a 
                        program written by you is efficient or 
                        not? This is measured by complexities. 
                        Complexity is of two types: 
                    </p> 
              
                    <li> 
                        <strong>Time Complexity:</strong> Time 
                        complexity is used to measure the amount 
                        of time required to execute the code. 
                    </li> 
                    <li> 
                        <strong>Space Complexity:</strong> 
                        Space complexity means the amount of 
                        space required to execute successfully 
                        the functionalities of the code. You 
                        will also come across the term Auxiliary 
                        Space very commonly in DSA, which refers 
                        to the extra space used in the program 
                        other than the input data structure. 
                    </li> 
                    <p> 
                        Both of the above complexities are 
                        measured with respect to the input 
                        parameters. But here arises a problem. 
                        The time required for executing a code 
                        depends on several factors, such as: 
                    </p> 
                    <li> 
                        The number of operations performed 
                        in the program 
                    </li> 
                    <li>The speed of the device, and also</li> 
                    <li> 
                        The speed of data transfer if being 
                        executed on an online platform. 
                    </li> 
                </div> 
            </body> 
              
            </html>
